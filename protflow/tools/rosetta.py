Rosetta Module
==============

This module provides the functionality to integrate Rosetta within the ProtFlow framework. It offers tools to run various Rosetta applications, handle their inputs and outputs, and process the resulting data in a structured and automated manner.

Detailed Description
--------------------
The `Rosetta` class encapsulates the functionality necessary to execute Rosetta runs. It manages the configuration of paths to essential scripts and executables, sets up the environment, and handles the execution of Rosetta processes. It also includes methods for collecting and processing output data, ensuring that the results are organized and accessible for further analysis within the ProtFlow ecosystem.
The module is designed to streamline the integration of Rosetta into larger computational workflows. It supports the automatic setup of job parameters, execution of Rosetta commands, and parsing of output files into a structured DataFrame format. This facilitates subsequent data analysis and visualization steps.

Usage
-----
To use this module, create an instance of the `Rosetta` class and invoke its `run` method with appropriate parameters. The module will handle the configuration, execution, and result collection processes. Detailed control over the Rosetta process is provided through various parameters, allowing for customized runs tailored to specific research needs.

Examples
--------
Here is an example of how to initialize and use the `Rosetta` class within a ProtFlow pipeline:

.. code-block:: python

    from protflow.poses import Poses
    from protflow.jobstarters import JobStarter
    from rosetta import Rosetta

    # Create instances of necessary classes
    poses = Poses()
    jobstarter = JobStarter()

    # Initialize the Rosetta class
    rosetta = Rosetta()

    # Run the Rosetta process
    results = rosetta.run(
        poses=poses,
        prefix="experiment_1",
        jobstarter=jobstarter,
        rosetta_application="RosettaScripts",
        nstruct=10,
        options="",
        pose_options=["-parser:protocol my_protocol.xml"],
        overwrite=True
    )

    # Access and process the results
    print(results)

Further Details
---------------
    - Edge Cases: The module handles various edge cases, such as invalid paths for executables and the need to overwrite previous results. It ensures robust error handling and logging for easier debugging and verification of the Rosetta process.
    - Customizability: Users can customize the Rosetta process through multiple parameters, including the number of structures (nstruct), specific options for the Rosetta application, and options for handling pose-specific parameters.
    - Integration: The module seamlessly integrates with other components of the ProtFlow framework, leveraging shared configurations and data structures to provide a cohesive user experience.

This module is intended for researchers and developers who need to incorporate Rosetta into their protein design and analysis workflows. By automating many of the setup and execution steps, it allows users to focus on interpreting results and advancing their scientific inquiries.

Notes
-----
This module is part of the ProtFlow package and is designed to work in tandem with other components of the package, especially those related to job management in HPC environments.

    Rosetta Class
    =============

    The `Rosetta` class is a specialized class designed to facilitate the execution of Rosetta applications within the ProtFlow framework. It extends the `Runner` class and incorporates specific methods to handle the setup, execution, and data collection associated with Rosetta processes.

    Detailed Description
    --------------------
    The `Rosetta` class manages all aspects of running Rosetta simulations. It handles the configuration of necessary scripts and executables, prepares the environment for Rosetta processes, and executes the Rosetta commands. Additionally, it collects and processes the output data, organizing it into a structured format for further analysis.

    Key functionalities include:
        - Setting up paths to Rosetta scripts and executables.
        - Configuring job starter options, either automatically or manually.
        - Handling the execution of Rosetta commands with support for multiple structures (nstruct).
        - Collecting and processing output data into a pandas DataFrame.
        - Cleaning and renaming PDB files based on Rosetta outputs.
        - Handling score files and converting them into a readable format.

    Returns
    -------

def collect_scores(work_dir: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Collects scores from Rosetta output files and reindexes PDB files.

    This function collects scores from Rosetta output files, reindexes PDB files based on the scores, and stores the scores in a pandas DataFrame. It also renames PDB files in the working directory to match the reindexed names.

    Parameters:
        work_dir (str): The directory where Rosetta output files are stored.

    Returns:
        pandas.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the collected scores with reindexed PDB file names.

    Examples:
        Here is an example of how to use the `collect_scores` function:

        .. code-block:: python

            from rosetta import collect_scores

            # Collect scores from the Rosetta output directory
            scores_df = collect_scores(work_dir="/path/to/output_directory")

            print(scores_df)

    Further Details:
        - **Score Collection:** The function collects score files from the specified directory and reads them into a pandas DataFrame.
        - **Reindexing:** The function reindexes the PDB files based on the scores and renames the files in the working directory accordingly.
        - **File Renaming:** The function ensures that all Rosetta output PDB files are renamed to match the reindexed names, and the paths to these files are stored in the DataFrame.
        - **Consistency Check:** The function waits for all Rosetta output files to appear in the output directory, ensuring that the renaming process is consistent and complete.

    This function is designed to streamline the process of collecting and organizing Rosetta output data, making it easier for researchers and developers to analyze the results of Rosetta simulations within the ProtFlow framework.

    """
    Cleans a faulty Rosetta scorefile.

    This function reads a Rosetta scorefile and removes any lines that do not match the expected format (i.e., lines with a different number of columns than the header). It writes the cleaned scores to a new file.

    Parameters:
        path_to_file (str): The path to the original Rosetta scorefile.
        out_path (str): The path where the cleaned scorefile will be saved.

    Returns:
        str: The path to the cleaned scorefile.

    Examples:
        Here is an example of how to use the `clean_rosetta_scorefile` function:

        .. code-block:: python

            from rosetta import clean_rosetta_scorefile

            print(f"Cleaned scorefile saved at: {cleaned_file_path}")

    Further Details:
        - **File Reading:** The function reads the scorefile line by line and splits each line into columns.
        - **Format Verification:** It verifies that each line has the same number of columns as the header. Lines with a different number of columns are removed.
        - **File Writing:** The cleaned scores are written to the specified output file. A warning is logged indicating the number of lines removed during the cleaning process.

    This function is useful for ensuring that Rosetta scorefiles are properly formatted and free of inconsistencies, facilitating accurate data analysis.
