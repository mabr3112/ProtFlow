ESMFold Module
==============

This module provides the functionality to integrate ESMFold within the ProtFlow framework. It offers tools to run ESMFold, handle its inputs and outputs, and process the resulting data in a structured and automated manner.

Detailed Description
--------------------
The `ESMFold` class encapsulates the functionality necessary to execute ESMFold runs. It manages the configuration of paths to essential scripts and Python executables, sets up the environment, and handles the execution of folding processes. It also includes methods for collecting and processing output data, ensuring that the results are organized and accessible for further analysis within the ProtFlow ecosystem.

The module is designed to streamline the integration of ESMFold into larger computational workflows. It supports the automatic setup of job parameters, execution of ESMFold commands, and parsing of output files into a structured DataFrame format. This facilitates subsequent data analysis and visualization steps.

Usage
-----
To use this module, create an instance of the `ESMFold` class and invoke its `run` method with appropriate parameters. The module will handle the configuration, execution, and result collection processes. Detailed control over the folding process is provided through various parameters, allowing for customized runs tailored to specific research needs.

Examples
--------
Here is an example of how to initialize and use the `ESMFold` class within a ProtFlow pipeline on a SLURM based queueing system:

.. code-block:: python

    from protflow.poses import Poses
    from protflow.jobstarters import JobStarter
    from esmfold import ESMFold

    # Create instances of necessary classes
    poses = Poses()
    jobstarter = SbatchArrayJobStarter(max_cores=10, gpus=1) # 1 gpu per node, 10 nodes at once.

    # Initialize the ESMFold class
    esmfold = ESMFold()

    # Run the folding process
    results = esmfold.run(
        poses=poses,
        prefix="experiment_1",
        jobstarter=jobstarter,
        num_batches=5,
        options="--additional_option=value",
        overwrite=True
    )

    # Access and process the results
    print(results)

Further Details
---------------
    - Edge Cases: The module handles various edge cases, such as empty pose lists and the need to overwrite previous results. It ensures robust error handling and logging for easier debugging and verification of the folding process.
    - Customizability: Users can customize the folding process through multiple parameters, including the number of batches, specific options for the ESMFold script, and options for handling pose-specific parameters.
    - Integration: The module seamlessly integrates with other components of the ProtFlow framework, leveraging shared configurations and data structures to provide a cohesive user experience.

This module is intended for researchers and developers who need to incorporate ESMFold into their protein design and analysis workflows. By automating many of the setup and execution steps, it allows users to focus on interpreting results and advancing their scientific inquiries.

Notes
-----
This module is part of the ProtFlow package and is designed to work in tandem with other components of the package, especially those related to job management in HPC environments.

    ESMFold Class
    =============

    The `ESMFold` class is a specialized class designed to facilitate the execution of ESMFold within the ProtFlow framework. It extends the `Runner` class and incorporates specific methods to handle the setup, execution, and data collection associated with ESMFold processes.
