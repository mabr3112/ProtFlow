RFdiffusion Module
==================

This module provides the functionality to integrate RFdiffusion within the ProtFlow framework. It offers tools to run RFdiffusion, handle its inputs and outputs, and process the resulting data in a structured and automated manner. 

Detailed Description
--------------------
The `RFdiffusion` class encapsulates the functionality necessary to execute RFdiffusion runs. It manages the configuration of paths to essential scripts and Python executables, sets up the environment, and handles the execution of diffusion processes. It also includes methods for collecting and processing output data, ensuring that the results are organized and accessible for further analysis within the ProtFlow ecosystem.
The module is designed to streamline the integration of RFdiffusion into larger computational workflows. It supports the automatic setup of job parameters, execution of RFdiffusion commands, and parsing of output files into a structured DataFrame format. This facilitates subsequent data analysis and visualization steps.

Usage
-----
To use this module, create an instance of the `RFdiffusion` class and invoke its `run` method with appropriate parameters. The module will handle the configuration, execution, and result collection processes. Detailed control over the diffusion process is provided through various parameters, allowing for customized runs tailored to specific research needs.

Examples
--------
Here is an example of how to initialize and use the `RFdiffusion` class within a ProtFlow pipeline:

.. code-block:: python

    from protflow.poses import Poses
    from protflow.jobstarters import JobStarter
    from rfdiffusion import RFdiffusion

    # Create instances of necessary classes
    poses = Poses()
    jobstarter = JobStarter()

    # Initialize the RFdiffusion class
    rfdiffusion = RFdiffusion()

    # Run the diffusion process
    results = rfdiffusion.run(
        poses=poses,
        prefix="experiment_1",
        jobstarter=jobstarter,
        num_diffusions=3,
        options="inference.num_designs=10",
        pose_options=["inference.input_pdb='input.pdb'"],
        overwrite=True
    )

    # Access and process the results
    print(results)

Further Details
---------------
    - Edge Cases: The module handles various edge cases, such as empty pose lists and the need to overwrite previous results. It ensures robust error handling and logging for easier debugging and verification of the diffusion process.
    - Customizability: Users can customize the diffusion process through multiple parameters, including the number of diffusions, specific options for the RFdiffusion script, and options for handling pose-specific parameters.
    - Integration: The module seamlessly integrates with other components of the ProtFlow framework, leveraging shared configurations and data structures to provide a cohesive user experience.

This module is intended for researchers and developers who need to incorporate RFdiffusion into their protein design and analysis workflows. By automating many of the setup and execution steps, it allows users to focus on interpreting results and advancing their scientific inquiries.

Notes
-----
This module is part of the ProtFlow package and is designed to work in tandem with other components of the package, especially those related to job management in HPC environments.

    RFdiffusion Class
    =================

    The `RFdiffusion` class is a specialized class designed to facilitate the execution of RFdiffusion within the ProtFlow framework. It extends the `Runner` class and incorporates specific methods to handle the setup, execution, and data collection associated with RFdiffusion processes.

    Detailed Description
    --------------------
    The `RFdiffusion` class manages all aspects of running RFdiffusion simulations. It handles the configuration of necessary scripts and executables, prepares the environment for diffusion processes, and executes the diffusion commands. Additionally, it collects and processes the output data, organizing it into a structured format for further analysis.

    Key functionalities include:
        - Setting up paths to RFdiffusion scripts and Python executables.
        - Configuring job starter options, either automatically or manually.
        - Handling the execution of RFdiffusion commands with support for multiple diffusions.
        - Collecting and processing output data into a pandas DataFrame.
        - Updating motifs based on RFdiffusion outputs and remapping residue selections.

        Initialize the RFdiffusion class.

        This constructor sets up the necessary paths to the RFdiffusion script and Python executable, and initializes the job starter. The paths are configured using default values from the ProtFlow configuration, but they can be manually set if required. However, manual setting is generally not recommended due to the potential for misconfiguration.

        Detailed Description
        --------------------
        The `__init__` method initializes the RFdiffusion class by setting up essential paths and configurations. It ensures that the paths to the RFdiffusion script and Python executable are correctly set, and it initializes the job starter object. This setup is crucial for the proper execution of RFdiffusion processes within the ProtFlow framework.

        Parameters
        ----------
        script_path (str, optional): The path to the RFdiffusion script. Defaults to the value specified in the ProtFlow configuration (`config.RFDIFFUSION_SCRIPT_PATH`).
        python_path (str, optional): The path to the Python executable used to run the RFdiffusion script. Defaults to the value specified in the ProtFlow configuration (`config.RFDIFFUSION_PYTHON_PATH`).
        jobstarter (JobStarter, optional): An instance of the JobStarter class, which manages job execution. If not provided, the default is `None`.
