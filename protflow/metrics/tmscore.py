    Difference Between TMscore and TMalign
    --------------------------------------
    - **TMscore**: This class calculates the TM-score between protein structures without superimposing them. It is suitable for comparing the overall similarity of protein structures in a sequence-length independent manner. TMscore is used when you need to score the structural similarity directly without modifying the positions of the structures.
    
    - **TMalign**: This class not only calculates the TM-score but also superimposes the structures before scoring. It is used when structural alignment and superimposition are necessary to get a more accurate measure of structural similarity, considering the spatial arrangement of the protein structures.

    The TMalign class is intended for researchers and developers who need to perform TMalign alignments as part of their protein structure comparison and analysis workflows. It simplifies the process, allowing users to focus on analyzing results and advancing their research.

    TMscore Class
    =============

    The `TMscore` class is a specialized class designed to facilitate the execution of TMscore within the ProtFlow framework. It extends the `Runner` class and incorporates specific methods to handle the setup, execution, and data collection associated with TMscore processes.

    Detailed Description
    --------------------
    The `TMscore` class manages all aspects of running TMscore simulations. It handles the configuration of necessary scripts and executables, prepares the environment for scoring processes, and executes the scoring commands. Additionally, it collects and processes the output data, organizing it into a structured format for further analysis.

    Key functionalities include:
        - Setting up paths to TMscore executables.
        - Configuring job starter options, either automatically or manually.
        - Handling the execution of TMscore commands with support for various scoring options.
        - Collecting and processing output data into a pandas DataFrame.

    Difference Between TMscore and TMalign
    --------------------------------------
    - **TMscore**: This class calculates the TM-score between protein structures without superimposing them. It is suitable for comparing the overall similarity of protein structures in a sequence-length independent manner. TMscore is used when you need to score the structural similarity directly without modifying the positions of the structures.
    
    - **TMalign**: This class not only calculates the TM-score but also superimposes the structures before scoring. It is used when structural alignment and superimposition are necessary to get a more accurate measure of structural similarity, considering the spatial arrangement of the protein structures.

    Returns
    -------
    An instance of the `TMscore` class, configured to run TMscore processes and handle outputs efficiently.

    Raises
    ------
        FileNotFoundError: If the TMscore executable is not found in the specified environment.
        ValueError: If invalid arguments are provided to the methods or if required reference columns are missing.
        RuntimeError: If no TM scores are found in the output files.

    Examples
    --------
    Here is an example of how to initialize and use the `TMscore` class:

    .. code-block:: python

        from protflow.poses import Poses
        from protflow.jobstarters import JobStarter
        from tmscore import TMscore

        # Create instances of necessary classes
        poses = Poses()
        jobstarter = JobStarter()

        # Initialize the TMscore class
        tmscore = TMscore()

        # Run the scoring process
        results = tmscore.run(
            poses=poses,
            prefix="experiment_2",
            ref_col="reference_pdb",
            options="-c",
            pose_options=["-d"],
            overwrite=True
        )

        # Access and process the results
        print(results)

    Further Details
    ---------------
        - Edge Cases: The class includes handling for various edge cases, such as empty pose lists, the need to overwrite previous results, and the presence of existing score files.
        - Customization: The class provides extensive customization options through its parameters, allowing users to tailor the scoring process to their specific needs.
        - Integration: Seamlessly integrates with other ProtFlow components, leveraging shared configurations and data structures for a unified workflow.

    The TMscore class is intended for researchers and developers who need to perform TMscore calculations as part of their protein structure comparison and analysis workflows. It simplifies the process, allowing users to focus on analyzing results and advancing their research.
