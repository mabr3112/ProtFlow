ProtParam Module
================

This module provides the functionality to integrate ProtParam calculations within the ProtFlow framework. It offers tools to compute various protein sequence features using the BioPython `Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam` module, handling inputs and outputs efficiently, and processing the resulting data in a structured and automated manner.

Detailed Description
--------------------
The `ProtParam` class encapsulates the functionality necessary to execute ProtParam calculations. It manages the configuration of paths to essential scripts and Python executables, sets up the environment, and handles the execution of parameter calculations. It also includes methods for collecting and processing output data, ensuring that the results are organized and accessible for further analysis within the ProtFlow ecosystem.
The module is designed to streamline the integration of ProtParam into larger computational workflows. It supports the automatic setup of job parameters, execution of ProtParam commands, and parsing of output files into a structured DataFrame format. This facilitates subsequent data analysis and visualization steps.

Usage
-----
To use this module, create an instance of the `ProtParam` class and invoke its `run` method with appropriate parameters. The module will handle the configuration, execution, and result collection processes. Detailed control over the ProtParam process is provided through various parameters, allowing for customized runs tailored to specific research needs.

Examples
--------
Here is an example of how to initialize and use the `ProtParam` class within a ProtFlow pipeline:

.. code-block:: python

    from protflow.poses import Poses
    from protflow.jobstarters import JobStarter
    from protparam import ProtParam

    # Create instances of necessary classes
    poses = Poses()
    jobstarter = JobStarter()

    # Initialize the ProtParam class
    protparam = ProtParam()

    # Run the ProtParam calculation process
    results = protparam.run(
        poses=poses,
        prefix="experiment_1",
        seq_col=None,
        pH=7,
        overwrite=True,
        jobstarter=jobstarter
    )

    # Access and process the results
    print(results)

Further Details
---------------
    - Edge Cases: The module handles various edge cases, such as empty pose lists and the need to overwrite previous results. It ensures robust error handling and logging for easier debugging and verification of the ProtParam process.
    - Customizability: Users can customize the ProtParam process through multiple parameters, including the pH for determining protein total charge, specific options for the ProtParam script, and options for handling pose-specific parameters.
    - Integration: The module seamlessly integrates with other components of the ProtFlow framework, leveraging shared configurations and data structures to provide a cohesive user experience.

This module is intended for researchers and developers who need to incorporate ProtParam calculations into their protein design and analysis workflows. By automating many of the setup and execution steps, it allows users to focus on interpreting results and advancing their scientific inquiries.

Notes
-----
This module is part of the ProtFlow package and is designed to work in tandem with other components of the package, especially those related to job management in HPC environments.
